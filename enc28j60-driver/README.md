This is a test for the basic functionality of the ethernet driver for the enc28j60 written by me.
Source files with documentation for the driver are present in the driver-files folder. 
The main test along with board config files and CMake files are in driver-test/.
CMake build doesn't yet work fully so the command for the link step is given in the CMakeLists.txt file separately. Once the build fails in the link step, just copy-paste the link command and proceed.
